        <h2>Live online UX/UI Bootcamps with micro classes around the world</h2>
        <p>
          Being presentation free, our online Bootcamps take a learn-by-doing
          approach, with designers collaborating live in the latest real-time
          design tools. It's been an amazing journey to date as a solo founder
          and we've got a 100% completion rate with 5/5 reviews from all of our
          alumni! Unlike others, Memorisely is 100% remote, 100% bootstrapped
          and on a mission to help new and experienced designers transition into
          working effectively as remote UX/UI Designers.
