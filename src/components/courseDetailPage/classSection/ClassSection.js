                        We think it's vital to have a personalised learning
                        experience and we purposefully limit class sizes to 20
                        Designers. Keeping class sizes small, ensures we can
                        cover more in the time we have and you'll learn directly
                        from other designers. Plus, it's a safe place to learn
                        with the whole class contributing to discussions and
                        sharing feedback.
